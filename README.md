# Geocity - build your (geo)-forms easily! ![Geocity CI](https://github.com/yverdon/geocity/workflows/Geocity%20CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

**[What is Geocity ?](https://geocity.ch/about)**

**[Features and user guide](https://github.com/yverdon/geocity/wiki)**


## Setting up full Docker non persistent demo

This will bring up a demo instance with preset fixtures served by the
Django developpment server in reload mode.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yverdon/geocity.git && cd geocity
cp -n env.demo .env
docker-compose build
docker-compose down --remove-orphans && docker-compose up
```

## Setting up production instance
### Database

1. Create a  postgres database
2. Install required extensions: postgis, pg_trgm, unaccent extension
3. Edit DB connection in .env file

### Environment variables

:warning: :warning: :warning:

Set following variables as follow
```ini
COMPOSE_FILE=
ENV=PROD
DEBUG=False
DEV_DEPENDENCIES=false
```

And review all other variables in order to fine tune your instance


### Site (subdomain) setting

:warning A minimum of one SITE object is required :warning

In order to use subdomains, you'll need a wildcard certificate and to list the domain in

```ini
ALLOWED_HOSTS
```

Please [read the Django doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/sites/)

## Developpment tools


### Setup your Environment file

Following variable setup in your .env file will setup the developpment environment for you

```ini
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose-demo.yml
COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR=:
ENV=DEV
DEBUG=True
DEV_DEPENDENCIES=true
CLEAR_PUBLIC_SCHEMA_ON_FIXTURIZE=true
```

### Run the tests from within the docker container

Run the tests:

```
./run_tests.sh
```

Example to run a single test in container

```bash
coverage run --source='.' ./manage.py test --settings=geomapshark.settings_test permits.tests.test_a_permit_request.PermitRequestTestCase.test_administrative_entity_is_filtered_by_tag
```

### Linting

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) as code formatter. Just use the following command to automatically format your code when you commit:

```
$ pip install pre-commit
$ pre-commit install
```

If you wish to run it on all files:

```
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Show urls

We use [django-extensions](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_extensions.html?highlight=show_urls#command-extensions) to show urls. Can be used to export models to a file (as text or picture), to display them in terminal and much more things

```
./manage.py show_urls
```

### Testing emails

A Mailhog container is working on the dev environment, you can access it by going to localhost:8025.
Just ensure to setup the following entries in your .env file:

```ini
EMAIL_HOST=mailhog
EMAIL_PORT=1025
EMAIL_HOST_USER=null
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=null
# Set TLS to false for mailhog
EMAIL_USE_TLS=false
EMAIL_TO_CONSOLE=false
```

### Dependency management

Dependencies are managed with [`pip-tools`](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools).

### Installing packages

To install a new package, add it to `requirements.in`, without pinning it to a
specific version unless needed. Then run:

```
docker-compose exec web pip-compile requirements.in
docker-compose exec web pip-compile requirements_dev.in
docker-compose exec web pip install -r requirements.txt
docker-compose exec web pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

Make sure you commit both the `requirements.in` and the `requirements.txt` files.
And the `requirements_dev.in` and the `requirements_dev.txt` files.

### Upgrading packages

To upgrade all the packages to their latest available version, run:

```
docker-compose exec web pip-compile -U requirements.in
docker-compose exec web pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To upgrade only a specific package, use `pip-compile -P <packagename>`.
The following commands will upgrade Django to its latest version, making sure
it's compatible with other packages listed in the `requirements.in` file:

```
docker-compose exec web pip-compile -P django requirements.in
docker-compose exec web pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Permissions and authentication

### Permissions

The user belonging to backoffice group can be granted specific permissions:
- `see_private_requests`, "Voir les demandes restreintes": allows the user to make requests that are not visible by standard user. Typically during the setup stage of a new form configuration
- `amend_permit_request`,"Traiter les demandes de permis": allow the user the process (amend) the requests (fill the backoffice fields), require validation for other departments and print the documents
- `validate_permit_request`,"Valider les demandes de permis": allow the user to fill the validation form
- `classify_permit_request`,"Classer les demandes de permis" allow the user to accept/reject the requests if validations services have all accepted it.
- `edit_permit_request`, "Ã‰diter les demandes de permis": allow the user to edit de requests filled by another person


### Two factor authentification

You can enable 2FA by setting the variable `ENABLE_2FA` to `true`. Defaults to `false`.

### Access to admin views under 2FA

Super users require to enable 2FA to have access to the admin app.

Follow the following steps:

1. Go to the `/account/login/` and sign in with your super user credentials.
2. Follow the steps to activate 2FA
3. Open `/admin/`

Next time you sign in, you will be asked for a token.
Once you provided your token go to `/admin/` to access the admin app.

### Locked failed logins

Django-axes is used to limite login attemps from users.
Please read https://django-axes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html to learn how to use it.

### Geocity as a OAuth2 provider
* [Access to a ressources with QGIS](docs/OAuth2_Qgis.md)
* [Access to a ressources with a bearer token](docs/OAuth2_access_api.md)

### Consuming OAuth2 providers
You can login with a GEOMAPFISH account if you have one.
* Create a SocialApp using the geomapfish provider.
* Add the fields required for oauth2 process:

```
client_id
secret
key
certificate_key
```

* Save the SocialApp, the GEOMAPFISH login is ready to use.
* Don't create 2 SocialApp with the same provider.

* Redirect URI configuration in oAuth provider for dev

```
http://localhost:9095/geomapfish/login/callback/
```

**Optional:**

Create a setting `SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS["geomapfish"]["APP"]` containing a dict with the same keys,
(`client_id`, `secret`, `key`, `certificate_key`).
This will override the data of any SocialApp with provider geomapfish.

**Warning:**

Geomapfish login process will raise an error if no APP settings and no SocialApp
object are present.

## Migrations

To run a migration, for example when the model has changed, execute
`manage.py makemigrations` from inside the docker service of the web app.
Then execute `manage.py migrate`.

```
docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py makemigrations <app_label>
docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py migrate <app_label> <migration_name>
```

For more information about django's migrations, help is available at:

```
docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py makemigrations --help
docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py migrate --help
```

### Practical example
Note: prepend `docker-compose exec web ` to the following python calls if your app is containerized.

`<app_label>`: this is set automatically depending on which model file is modified. In Geocity, it will always be "permits" => so there is nothing to specify.

`<migration_name>`: we try to name it with something meaningful, but there is no convention, for example, this command: `python manage.py makemigrations -n my_changes_to_the_user_model` will automatically create the following migration file for the "permits" app_label: `0056_my_changes_to_the_user_model.py`

Finally, you can apply it using:
`python manage.py migrate permits 0056_my_changes_to_the_user_model`

## Wiki

Sidebar of wiki to show the new pages is managed by : [github-wiki-sidebar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-wiki-sidebar).

Used `_` instead of `:` for `Define the category separator` because the character was not allowed, the other params juste press enter and keep it has default.

```bash
? Define the category separator for multi-level menu: _
? Define the format of the page links: ./%s
? Define the _Sidebar.md content template: %s
? Select the items to be excluded from menu: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
? Change the priority/order of the items in menu <space separated list of ids - ex: 0 2 3>
```



## Cronjobs

To manage the planned tasks we use the django-cron extension (https://github.com/Tivix/django-cron). The script to be executed is defined on the **permits/cron.py** file.

In order to run it on a server instance, modify the following line accordingly and add it to the crontab:

```
*/10 * * * * <path_to_manage.py>/manage.py runcrons >/dev/null 2>&1
```
